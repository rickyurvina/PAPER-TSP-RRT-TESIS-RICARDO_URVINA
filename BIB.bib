   abstract = {The term "Agri-Food 4.0" is an analogy to the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept "agriculture 4.0". Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this particular domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, still remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.},

   abstract = {Most of the existing harvesting strategies rely on traditional path planners that only minimize the length of the path or energy consumption, ignoring the state of the crops and production process. Furthermore, the existing approaches use simplified kinematic models that neglect the robots' dynamics and their interaction with the terrain. To address these limitations, we propose and test in the field a harvesting and motion-planning strategy that explicitly considers the expected plant yield and the terrain's traversability. The latter has direct impact in the energy management of the agricultural service unit. A map with the predicted yield of each plant is employed to determine a priority queue of harvesting points. The priority queue, together with the harvesting rate and the robot's payload capacity, are used to generate a harvesting schedule for the different locations in the grove. The joint harvesting and motion-planning strategy applied is evaluated using field data from a Chilean avocado grove during the harvesting season. The results show that the proposed strategy provides a useful approach to automate the harvest points scheduling and motion planning while saving machinery resources.},

Among them, the exploration of efficiency and traversal issues is the embodiment of effectiveness. To solve this problem, an Intelligent Rapidly-exploration Random Tree (IRRT) algorithm based on evolutionary cognition is proposed. This algorithm can intelligently adjust the growth rate of the global tree according to the complete situation of the exploration map. Using the method of simultaneous generation of global tree and local tree to explore boundary points, the detected boundary points are filtered by the DBSCAN clustering method to obtain the target point set, which is used as the current target point of the robot movement. Simulation verification in the Robot Operating System (ROS) shows that the algorithm can complete the traversal of the unknown environment, and effectively reduce the time cost.},

   abstract = {In this letter, we propose a novel sampling-based planner for multi-goal path planning among obstacles, where the objective is to visit predefined target locations while minimizing the travel costs. The order of visiting the targets is often achieved by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or its variants. TSP requires to define costs between the individual targets, which - in a map with obstacles - requires to compute mutual paths between the targets. These paths, found by path planning, are used both to define the costs (e.g., based on their length or time-to-traverse) and also they define paths that are later used in the final solution. To enable TSP finding a good-quality solution, it is necessary to find these target-to-target paths as short as possible. We propose a sampling-based planner called Space-Filling Forest (SFF*) that solves the part of finding collision-free paths. SFF* uses multiple trees (forest) constructed gradually and simultaneously from the targets and attempts to find connections with other trees to form the paths. Unlike Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which uses the nearest-neighbor rule for selecting nodes for expansion, SFF* maintains an explicit list of nodes for expansion. Individual trees are grown in a RRT* manner, i.e., with rewiring the nodes to minimize their cost. Computational results show that SFF* provides shorter target-to-target paths than existing approaches, and consequently, the final TSP solutions also have a lower cost.},

   abstract = {The population of the world is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050, implying that agricultural output must continue to rise. To deal with population expansion, agricultural chores must be mechanized and automated. Over the last decade, ground robots have been developed for a variety of agricultural applications, with autonomous and safe navigation being one of the most difficult hurdles in this development. When a mobile platform moves autonomously, it must perform a variety of tasks, including localization, route planning, motion control, and mapping, which is a critical stage in autonomous operations. This research examines several agricultural applications as well as the path planning approach used. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current literature on path/trajectory planning aspects of ground robots in agriculture using a systematic literature review technique, to contribute to the goal of contributing new information in the field. Coverage route planning appears to be less advanced in agriculture than point-to-point path routing, according to the finding, which is due to the fact that covering activities are usually required for agricultural applications, but precision agriculture necessitates point-to-point navigation. In the recent era, precision agriculture is getting more attention. The conclusion presented here demonstrates that both field coverage and point-to-point navigation have been applied successfully in path planning for agricultural robots.},

The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot.

Path planning technology, which primarily includes modeling methods and path search algorithms, is an important technology for AUVs. In recent years, the AUV path planning technology has rapidly developed. Compared with land robots, AUVs must endure complex underwater environments and consider various factors, such as currents, water pressure, and topography. Challenges exist in terms of online obstacle avoidance, three-dimensional environment path planning, and the robustness of the algorithms. Adapting a complex environment and finding a suitable path planning method comprise the main problem that must be solved. In this paper, we summarize the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of modeling and path search technologies for AUVs. The most prominent feature of this paper is to summarize the improvement methods of various technical shortcomings and improve the original methods, such as dynamic obstacle avoidance, optimization path, coverage, and processing speed. In addition to summarizing the characteristics of each algorithm, this paper intuitively demonstrates the experimental environment, the real-time nature, the path planning range of the AUV, and so on. We also discuss the application scenarios of various modeling and path search technologies for AUVs. In addition, we discuss the challenges of AUVs and the direction of future research.},

A steering angle plays an essential and fundamental role in the function of autonomous vehicle and the path planning because it controls the vehicle direction. However, the steering angle cannot be calibrated directly from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) due to the limitation of GNSS parameters. In addition, the accuracy of steering angle obtained from the analysis of Global Position System (GPS) information cannot satisfy the accuracy requirements in engineering applications. In this paper, a novel approach to improve accuracy of steering angle is proposed. Low-cost Micro-electromechanical System (MEMS) and GPS are combined on an agriculture vehicle so that the steering angle can be calculated precisely. Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are used in simulations to estimate the steering angle. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve increased accuracy of estimation of steering angle than that based merely on GPS information. Because the cost of a MEMS gyroscope is very low, the proposed method is a practical way to achieve precision agriculture with high accuracy.},

Line-of-Sight (LoS) is the straight path between two points, and LoS-Check is often used as a path shortcutting method. Lazy evaluation is a successful strategy in reducing the amount of collision detection, which accelerates the motion planning algorithms, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present Lazy LoS-Check (LaLo-Check), which employs a lazy evaluation strategy with the help of a lower bound technique to delay the LoS-Check until it is necessary. The lower bound technique only accepts the states which could provide a better solution, and it is commonly applied in the sample rejection and candidate path selection. Actually, LaLo-Check can be considered as a general path optimization framework, which could be used in most tree-structure motion planners. We choose three representative sampling-based motion planning algorithms, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and BIT*, to evaluate the performance of LaLo-Check. The experimental results show that the new planners which employ the LaLo-Check could find better solutions than the original algorithms within the equivalent time.},

   abstract = {Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are successful in single-query motion planning problems. The standard version of RRT grows a tree from a start location and stops once it reached the goal configuration. RRT-Connect is the bidirectional version of RRT, which grows two trees simultaneously. These two trees try to establish a connection to stop searching. RRT-Connect finds solutions faster than RRT. Following that, an asymptotically optimal version of RRT-Connect called RRT*-Connect has been introduced. It not only rewires both trees while they are growing, but also it keeps searching the state space for better solutions than the current one. However, it is inefficient and inconsistent to search all over the state space in order to find better solutions than the current one concerning its single-query nature. The better way is to look through states that can provide a better solution. In this paper, we propose Informed RRT*-Connect, which is the informed version of RRT*-Connect that uses direct sampling after the first solution found. Unlike RRT*-Connect, the proposed method checks only the states that can potentially provide better solutions than the current solution. The proposed method benefited from the properties of RRT*-Connect and informed sampling, which offers low-cost solutions with fewer iterations in comparison to RRT*-Connect. Different simulations in OMPL have been carried out to show the significance of Informed RRT*-Connect in comparison with RRT*, Informed RRT*, and RRT*-Connect.},

   abstract = {An obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm for a multi-joint manipulator in a space robot is presented in this paper. In this paper, the end-effector of the manipulator is used to capture some special target in a space environment with obstacles. To ensure the safety of the operation, a collision-free path from the initial position to the target position is essential. Therefore, an obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and the Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm is presented in this paper. First, a path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is designed for the multi-joint manipulator. Further, a method to generate a random point by artificial guidance is introduced for a higher searching speed. The RRT algorithm can effectively explore the entire workspace and find a feasible path without collision for the end-effector. To calculate the positions of each joint, the Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm is introduced and improved for the problem of inverse kinematics. The FABRIK algorithm avoids the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position by locating a point on a line, and thus, it has a low computational cost. Therefore, the improved obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm can quickly plan a feasible path for the multi-joint manipulator in a space environment with obstacles. A numerical simulation is carried out to analyze the proposed obstacle avoidance and path planning method. It is observed that the method finds a feasible path without collision for the multi-joint manipulator with a low computational cost. These results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for path planning to avoid the obstacles.},

   abstract = {In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications such as land assessment, search and rescue, and precision agriculture, UAVs are often required to survey multiple spatially distributed regions. To perform these applications, one of the key steps is to plan the path for the UAV to quickly cover all regions. The new path planning problem explored here, which we call the TSP-CPP problem, can be viewed as an integration of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the coverage path planning (CPP) problem, which has not been well studied in the literature. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on the TSP-CPP problem. In particular, we first provide a mixed integer programming formulation for this new problem, and then introduce a CPP method for covering a single convex polygonal region. Based on this method, we then develop two approaches to solve the TSP-CPP problem, including 1) a dynamic programming-based exact approach that can find the (near) optimal tour, and 2) a heuristic approach that can generate high-quality tours very efficiently. Through comprehensive theoretical analyses and simulation studies, we demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of the proposed approaches.},

   abstract = {Rapidly random-exploring tree (RRT) and its variants are very popular due to their ability to quickly and efficiently explore the state space. However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT* (NRRT*). The NRRT* utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path planning cases. In this article, we use the A* algorithm to generate the training data set consisting of the map information and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the NRRT*. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT* can achieve convincing performance compared with the state-of-The-Art path planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance. The NRRT* can be also applied to other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in different applications.},

   abstract = {This work addresses the problem of robust tracking control for skid-steer mobile platforms, using tube-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. The strategy seeks to mitigate the impact of disturbances propagated to autonomous vehicles originated by traction losses. To this end, a dynamical model composed by two coupled sub-systems stands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle dynamics and tire behavior. The controller is aimed at tracking prescribed stable operation points of the slip and side-slip beyond the robot pose and speeds. To reach robust tracking performance on the global system, a centralized control scheme operates under a predictive control framework composed by three control actions. The first one compensates for disturbances using the reference trajectory-feedforward control. The second control action corrects the errors generated by the modeling mismatch. The third one is devoted to ensure robustness on the closed-loop system whilst compensating for deviations of the state trajectories from the nominal ones (i.e. disturbance-free). The strategy ensures robust feasibility even when tightening constraints are met. Such constraints are calculated on-line based on robust positively invariant sets characterized by polytopic sets (tubes), including a terminal region to guarantee robustness. The benefits of the controller regarding tracking performance, constraint satisfaction and computational practicability were tested through simulations with a Cat 262C skid-steer model. Then, in field tests, the controller evidenced high tracking accuracy against terrain disturbances when benchmarking performance with respect to inherent robust predictive controllers.},

   abstract = {The path planned by the rapidly expanding random tree (RRT) algorithm is tortuous and the planning speed of RRT algorithm is slow. The path planning failure rate of the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is high in complex scenarios. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion algorithm fusing PRM and probability-based bidirectional RRT (P-Bi-RRT), which divides the planning area into two areas on average, and uses the PRM algorithm with faster planning speed for path pre-planning in each area, and then selects a node in each of the two areas to form a pair of optimal matching-points. The optimal matching-points is used to connect the two regional paths with the P-Bi-RRT algorithm or method of barrier-free direct connection. Finally, the planned path is optimized twice, the redundant nodes are trimmed and the path length is shortened. After a large number of simulation experiments, it is shown that the time of path planning is reduced by about 71% to 80%, the number of nodes is reduced by 70% to 80%, and the path length is shortened by 20% to 30% compared with the RRT algorithm.},

   abstract = {The tractor-trailer wheeled robot (TTWR) is a typical modular mobile robot system. It is widely used in industry and agriculture transportation because of its simple structure, heavy load, high efficiency, strong adaptability, and flexibility. Because it is a nonlinear and underactuated system subjected to nonholonomic constraints, the complexity of the system and influence of the inner wheel difference pose great challenges to its trajectory prediction and path planning. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a trajectory prediction algorithm for an unpowered trailer for the TTWR system. In contrast to traditional single-path planning, the algorithm combines the motion characteristics of the Ackermann chassis tractor, analyzes the trailer motion law, and fully considers the lateral deviation of the trailer during the turning process. The algorithm can plan a reasonable cooperative path for the TTWR system. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, the algorithm is transplanted to the TTWR intelligent experimental platform. A comparison of the simulation and experimental results shows that under the control of the preview tracking algorithm, the maximum error between the actual trajectory of the trailer and the trajectory predicted by the algorithm is generally no more than 9 cm, and the average error is 3.7 cm. This algorithm can provide an effective basis for TTWR system trajectory planning and path tracking. This algorithm is of great significance to TTWRs in warehousing logistics, freight forwarding, and skidding transportation.},

However, the trap space problem, such as mazes and S-shaped corridors, hinders their planning efficiency. In this article, we present a generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD)-based heuristic path planning algorithm to generate a heuristic path, guide the sampling process of RRTs, and further improve the motion planning efficiency of RRTs. Different from other heuristic algorithms that only work in certain environments or depend on specified parameter setting, the proposed algorithm can automatically identify the environment feature and provide a reasonable heuristic path. First, the given environment is initialized with a lightweight feature extraction from the GVD, which guarantees that any state in the free space can be connected to the feature graph without any collision. Second, to remove the redundancy of feature nodes, a feature matrix is proposed to represent connections among feature nodes and a corresponding feature node fusion technique is utilized to delete the redundant nodes. Third, based on the GVD feature matrix, a heuristic path planning algorithm is presented. This heuristic path is then used to guide the sampling process of RRTs and achieve real-time motion planning. The proposed GVD feature matrix can be also utilized to improve the efficiency of the replanning. Through a series of simulation studies and real-world implementations, it is confirmed that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in heuristic path planning, feature extraction of free space, and real-time motion planning.},

We hypothesized path planning for an agricultural harvesting robot, a spraying robot, and an agricultural transport robot, and conducted experiments in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. In addition, the set parameters are validated experimentally. The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to confirm the shape of the normal distribution, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test are performed to confirm the significance of the experimental results. Smart farms aim to minimize crop damage; thus, it is vital to reach the goal point accurately rather than quickly.

The agent can benefit from the model learned online in distinguishing what terrains are easy to traverse and which should be avoided. The proposed solution enables the learning of multiple traversability models, each associated with a particular locomotion gait, a walking pattern of a multi-legged walking robot. We propose to address the simultaneous learning of the environment and traversability models by a decoupled approach. Thus, navigation waypoints are generated using the current spatial and traversability models to gain the information necessary to improve the particular model during the robot’s motion in the environment. From the set of possible waypoints, the decision on where to navigate next is made based on the solution of the generalized traveling salesman problem that allows taking into account a planning horizon longer than a single myopic decision. The proposed approach has been verified in simulated scenarios and experimental deployments with a real hexapod walking robot with two locomotion gaits, suitable for different terrains. Based on the achieved results, the proposed method exploits the online learned traversability models and further supports the selection of the most appropriate locomotion gait for the particular terrain types.},

abstract = {Skid-steered tracked vehicles are the favoured platform for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in poor terrain conditions. However, the concept of skid-steering relies largely on track slippage to allow the vehicle to conduct turning manoeuvres potentially leading to overly high slip and immobility. It is therefore important to predict such vulnerable vehicle states in order to prevent their occurrence and thus paving the way for improved autonomy of tracked vehicles. This paper presents an analytical approach to track–terrain modelling and a novel traversability prediction simulator for tracked vehicles conducting steady-state turning manoeuvres on soft terrain. Traversability is identified by predicting the resultant track forces acting on the track–terrain interface and the adopted models are modified to provide an analytical generalised solution. The validity of the simulator has been verified by comparison with available data in the literature and through an in-house experimental study. The developed simulator can be employed as a traversability predictor and also as a design tool to test the performance of tracked vehicles with different vehicle geometries operating on a wide range of soil properties.}

   Abstract = {Contact mechanics plays an important role in the design, performance
   analysis, simulation, and control of legged robots. The Hunt-Crossley

   knowledge of terramechanics and reveals the relationship between the
   parameters of the conventional models and the terramechanics models. The
   proposed models are derived in three categories: deformable foot on hard
   terrain, hard foot on deformable terrain, and deformable foot on
   deformable terrain. A novel model of tangential forces as the function
   of displacement is proposed on the basis of an in-depth understanding of
   the terrain properties. Methods for identifying the model parameters are
   also developed. Extensive foot-soil interaction experiments have been

   title ={Simulation software and virtual environments for acceleration of agricultural robotics: Features highlights and performance comparison},
   Abstract = {Research efforts for development of agricultural robots that can effectively perform tedious field tasks have grown significantly in the past decade. Agricultural robots are complex systems that require interdisciplinary collaborations between different research groups for effective task delivery in unstructured crops and plants environments. With the exception of milking robots, the extensive research works that have been carried out in the past two decades for adaptation of robotics in agriculture have not yielded a commercial product to date. To accelerate this pace, simulation approach and evaluation methods in virtual environments can provide an affordable and reliable framework for experimenting with different sensing and acting mechanisms in order to verify the performance functionality of the robot in dynamic scenarios. This paper reviews several professional simulators and custom-built virtual environments that have been used for agricultural robotic applications. The key features and performance efficiency of three selected simulators were also compared. A simulation case study was demonstrated to highlight some of the powerful functionalities of the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform. Details of the objects and scenes were presented as the proof-of-concept for using a completely simulated robotic platform and sensing systems in a virtual citrus orchard. It was shown that the simulated workspace can provide a configurable and modular prototype robotic system that is capable of adapting to several field conditions and tasks through easy testing and debugging of control algorithms with zero damage risk to the real robot and to the actual equipment. This review suggests that an open-source software platform for agricultural robotics will significantly accelerate effective collaborations between different research groups for sharing existing workspaces, algorithms, and reusing the materials.},

   abstract = {The dense population and high solid waste production make it challenging to determine the optimal routes for garbage collection trucks in metropolitan cities. Moreover, incorrectly planned routes cause waste of fuel, time, and other resources in the municipal garbage collection process. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to find optimal routes for a certain number of vehicles that start from a depot, visit all customers, and return to the depot. This study aims to find the optimal routes that satisfy all the needs by considering the waste collection process of the Istanbul Umraniye district. Data on the currently used routes, daily tonnages, number of truck trips, and the number and locations of containers in the Umraniye district were obtained from the Umraniye municipality. We solve the route optimization problem of the Umraniye municipality with multiple heuristics and meta-heuristic algorithms like the nearest neighbor, savings, Christofides, simulated annealing, greedy descent, guided local search, and Tabu Search algorithms. We show the examined heuristics and meta-heuristics can produce fast and feasible solutions to large-size real-life problems.},

Against this context, the paper presents an overview on wheeled mobile robot (WMR), which have a central role in nowadays scenario. In particular, the paper describes the most commonly adopted locomotion strategies, perception systems, control architectures and navigation approaches. After having analyzed the state of the art, this paper focuses on the kinematics of three omnidirectional platforms: a four mecanum wheels robot (4WD), a three omni wheel platform (3WD) and a two swerve-drive system (2SWD). Through a dimensionless approach, these three platforms are compared to understand how their mobility is affected by the wheel speed limitations that are present in every practical application. This original comparison has not been already presented by the literature and it can be used to improve our understanding of the kinematics of these mobile robots and to guide the selection of the most appropriate locomotion system according to the specific application.},

Unfortunately, they require high power and are spatially distributed over a large area. Till now, some elements of the conveyor (drive units) have been monitored 24 h/day using SCADA systems. The rest of the conveyor is inspected by maintenance staff. To minimize the presence of humans in harsh environments, we propose a mobile inspection platform based on autonomous UGV. It is equipped with various sensors, and in practice it is capable of collecting almost the same information as maintenance inspectors (RGB image, sound, gas sensor, etc.). Till now such experiments have been performed in the lab or in the mine, but the robot was controlled by the operator. In such a scenario the robot is able to record data, process them and detect, for example, an overheated idler. In this paper we will introduce the general concept of an automatic robot-based inspection for underground mining applications. A framework of how to deploy the inspection robot for automatic inspection (3D model of the tunnel, path planing, etc.) are defined and some first results from automatic inspection tested in lab conditions are presented. Differences between the planned and actual path are evaluated. We also point out some challenges for further research.},

   abstract = {Differential Drive Wheeled Mobile Robot (DDWMR) is a nonholonomic robot with constrained movement. Such constraint makes robot position control more difficult. A closed-loop control system such as PID can control robot position. However, DDWMR is a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output system. There will be many feedback gains to be tuned, and the wrong value will make the system unstable. Therefore this research proposes an offline autotune method to choose optimal feedback gain that minimizes a fitness function. The fitness function uses Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE). These works propose to autotune feedback gain for DDWMR Jetbot, which implements a PI control system with six feedback gains. The methods used to tune the feedback gain are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA). There are four different scenarios to do the autotune. The autotune result performance shows that those two methods can find an optimal gain to make the robot follow four different continuous trajectories without much trajectory deformation. PSO and BSA can do an autotune PI gain with six variables to minimize the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE).},

The objective of solving the vehicle routing problem is to deliver the products or goods in a right destination with some time management.

ABSTRACT = {Commonly used robot map models include occupancy grid maps, topological maps, and semantic maps. Among these, an occupancy grid map is mainly represented as a quadrilateral grid. This paper proposes an occupancy information grid for intelligent robots by exploiting the advantages of the occupancy grid map and spatial information grid. In terms of geometric structure, a regular hexagonal grid is used instead of a regular quadrilateral grid. In terms of attribute structure, the single obstacle attribute is replaced by the grid terrain characteristics, grid element attributes, and grid edge attributes. Thus, the occupancy information grid model is transformed into a new data structure describing the spatial environment, and it can be effectively applied to map construction and path planning of intelligent robots. For the map construction application of intelligent robots, this paper describes the basic process of laser sensor-based grid model construction. For the path planning application of intelligent robots, this paper extends the A* algorithm based on a regular hexagonal grid. Additionally, map construction and path planning applications for intelligent robots are experimentally verified. Several experimental results were obtained. First, the experimental results confirmed the theoretical conclusion that the minimum sampling density of the hexagonal structure was 13.4% lower than that of the quadrilateral structure. Second, the regular hexagonal grid is clearly more advantageous in describing environmental scenes, which can ameliorate the "undercompleteness" phenomenon. Third, there were large differences in the planning paths based on two types of grids, as shown by the fact that the distance of the planning paths obtained by the regular hexagonal grid was reduced by at least 10.8% and at most 15.6% compared with the regular quadrilateral grid.},

ABSTRACT = {Providing mobile robots with autonomous capabilities is advantageous. It allows one to dispense with the intervention of human operators, which may prove beneficial in economic and safety terms. Autonomy requires, in most cases, the use of path planners that enable the robot to deliberate about how to move from its location at one moment to another. Looking for the most appropriate path planning algorithm according to the requirements imposed by users can be challenging, given the overwhelming number of approaches that exist in the literature. Moreover, the past review works analyzed here cover only some of these approaches, missing important ones. For this reason, our paper aims to serve as a starting point for a clear and comprehensive overview of the research to date. It introduces a global classification of path planning algorithms, with a focus on those approaches used along with autonomous ground vehicles, but is also extendable to other robots moving on surfaces, such as autonomous boats. Moreover, the models used to represent the environment, together with the robot mobility and dynamics, are also addressed from the perspective of path planning. Each of the path planning categories presented in the classification is disclosed and analyzed, and a discussion about their applicability is added at the end.},

abstract = {A method for harvest planning based on the coupling of crop assignment with vehicle routing is presented. Given a setting with multiple fields, a path network connecting these, multiple depots at which a number of harvesters are initially located, the main question addressed is: Which crop out of a set of different crops to assign to each field when accounting for the given setting? It must be answered by every farm manager at the beginning of every work-cycle starting with plant seeding and ending with harvesting. Rather than solving an assignment problem only, it is here also accounted for the connectivity between fields. In practice, fields are often located distant apart. Traveling costs of machinery and limited harvesting windows demand optimized operation and route planning. Therefore, the proposed method outputs crop assignments to fields and simultaneously determines crop-tours, i.e., optimized sequences in which to service fields of the same crop during harvest. It is of particular relevance for larger farms and groups of farms that collaborate and share machinery. Integer programming based exact algorithms are derived. For large numbers of fields, where these algorithms may not be tractable due to computational constraints, elements of clustering and the solution of local Traveling Salesman Problems are added, thereby on the one hand rendering the method heuristic and in general suboptimal, but on the other hand maintaining large-scale applicability.}

The grain, harvested by combine-harvesters, is then transported by transporters from disperse farmlands to the depot. The spot where combine-harvesters transfer wheat to transporters is dynamic because the location of these spots correspond with combine-harvesters’ work. In this paper, the harvesting and transportation problem is considered as a two-echelon multi-trip vehicle routing problem with a dynamic satellite (2E-MTVRPDS) because the combine-harvester is used multiple times in the planning horizon and the transporter is used multiple times in a work day. The mixed integer linear programming model is proposed based on the features of the problem. This work presents an optimum solution with a heuristic algorithm. The dynamic satellite is transferred as the static case in the heuristic. The computational experiments are constructed to test the performances of the proposed algorithm. Five instances with different sizes are adopted to test the stability of the algorithm. The calculation deviation of testing instances is acceptable. On one hand, the optimal effectiveness can be achieved when the number of instances is less than 200. With the increase in the number of instances, the optimal efficiency declines. On the other hand, the optimal solution appears to have a time window of 0.2 h in all instances with different sizes. This study provides a decision model for agricultural production to implement optimal harvesting operations.}

This paper introduces an integrated first-mile pickup and last-mile delivery logistics problem, where agro-food grains are available at multiple farmer’s locations and are in demand by businesses like e-retailers, supermarkets, grocery shops, restaurants, hotels, etc. In addition, this work addresses a sustainable framework for agro-food grains supply chain (AFGSC) in urban and rural areas for e-commerce in developing countries. The proposed optimisation model considers costs related to first-mile pickup, transportation with last-mile delivery, carbon emission tax, inventory holding, vehicle and food damage due to accidents, and penalties on late pickup and delivery. This model also takes environmental and social (due to accidents) sustainability aspects into consideration, along with the economic aspects of sustainability. To solve the large complex practical scenarios by using four nature-inspired algorithms. The obtained results of this study are used to recommend significant managerial insights for implementing AFGSC in the e-commerce industry in considering practical conditions. Moreover, policy implications in terms of economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability are also discussed. }

ABSTRACT = {In view of the difficulties of fruit cluster identification, the specific harvesting sequence constraints of aggregated fruits, and the balanced harvesting task assignment for the multiple arms with a series-increasing symmetric shared (SISS) region, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which combines genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) stepwise, to optimize the multiarm cooperative harvesting trajectory of straw-rotting fungus to effectively improve the harvesting efficiency and the success rate of non-destructive harvesting. In this approach, firstly, the multiarm trajectory optimization problem is abstracted as a multiple travelling salesman problem (MTSP). Secondly, an improved local density clustering algorithm is designed to identify the cluster fruits to prepare data for harvesting aggregated fruits in a specific order later. Thirdly, the MTSP has been decomposed into M independent TSP (traveling salesman problem) problems by using GA, in which a new DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) assignment rule is designed to resolve the problem of the average distribution of multiarm harvesting tasks with the SISS region. Then, the improved ant colony algorithm, combined with the auction mechanism, is adopted to achieve the shortest trajectory of each arm, which settles the difficulty that the clustered mature fruits should be harvested in a specified order. The experiments show that it can search for a relatively stable optimal solution in a relatively short time. The average harvesting efficiency is up to 1183 pcs/h and the average harvesting success rate is about 97%. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can better plan the harvesting trajectory for multiarm intelligent harvesting, especially for areas with many aggregated fruits.},

abstract = {Abstract Metaheuristic algorithms such as ant colony optimization (ACO) and firefly (FF) have been successfully employed to solve the optimization problems such as robot motion planning in dynamic environments. The systematic plantation of rubber trees on a rectangular grid motivated us to explore application of grid search algorithms. We compared the ACO and FF algorithms in various scenarios by changing simulation parameters like density of the environment, land size, number of robots simultaneously available, and hillock plantations. In all different scenarios, we evaluated the performance of ACO and FF in terms of path length and time of execution, we found that later is outperforming the former. Regression equations are framed to establish the contributions of different parameters. Statistical significance of the results has been in favor of this hypothesis. The shortest path on a plain land is the relatively simplest scenario, while the Hamiltonian on a concave surface is arguably the most difficult. The novelty of this work lies in the very idea of an autonomous robot for the rubber tapping and then path optimization by employing soft computing techniques. This proposal of rubber harvesting robot if implemented for latex collection, has a potential to drive the rubber farming and allied businesses to scale up the economy of the coastal areas of India, say for example, Kerala.},

abstract = { It has been more than 30 years since the French pioneered the research of the apple harvesting robot, and with the joint efforts of scholars all around the world, a variety of prototypes have been developed. However, the existing apple harvesting robot prototype is still in the experimental research stage because of its low harvesting efficiency. With the help of information technology, the related research has ushered in a milestone development, and it is full of opportunities and challenges for apple harvesting robotic researchers. In this article, it briefly introduced the development history, structure, and composition of apple harvesting robots and the operation process, which makes readers have a clear understanding of apple harvesting robot and its harvesting principle. Then systematically summarizing the research results of apple harvesting robots both at domestic and at foreign, we carried out in following three aspects: rapid and accurate recognition and positioning of target fruit, all-weather operation mode, and application of intelligent computing theory in apple harvesting robots, and it analyzes the research progress of apple harvesting robot in detail. The results show that improving the harvesting efficiency is the key and hot spot for the research on apple harvesting robots. Under the impetus of information technology, how to achieve fast and accurate recognition of the fruits of multienvironment and multiple information, obtain reasonable path planning, and further optimization of control strategies are all important research directions. }

abstract = {Duration of Agricultural operations is a crucial issue in fleet management as it directly affects the operation costs. Agricultural fleet usually traverses paths, covering the whole field to complete the operation. The agricultural operations are not necessarily performed efficiently due to the various variables including field shape, presence of obstacles in the field, number of vehicles, and their specifications. In this study, agricultural operations are modeled as a capacitated arc routing problem (CARP). CARP is a combinatorial optimization problem, which determines the harvest paths in a field and finds the best order of traversing. By dividing the paths into two categories of required and non-required, CARP demonstrates a field as a graph. Using CARP, no extra or invalid edge on the graph would be needed. As CARP is an NP-Hard problem, a solution algorithm based on adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) is employed to solve large instances of the problem under study. The proposed ALNS algorithm is applied to well-known problem instances as well as a realistic case study to achieve the optimal harvesting pattern efficiently. The computational results demonstrate that the ALNS algorithm surpasses the conventional harvesting pattern. The amount of improvement obtained by the proposed method could vary due to the several factors, including the depot location, vehicle capacity, and field shape.}

@article{Yahia2023,
   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been increasingly popular in various areas, fields, and applications. Military, disaster management, rescue operations, public services, agriculture, and various other areas are examples. As a result, UAV path planning is concerned with determining the optimal path from the source to the destination while avoiding collisions with lowering the cost of time, energy, and other resources. This review aims to assort academic studies on the path planning optimization in UAV using meta-heuristic algorithms, summarize the results of each optimization algorithm, and extend the understanding of the current state of the path planning in UAV in the meta-heuristic optimization field. For this purpose, we implemented a broad, automated search using Boolean and snowballing searching methods to find academic works on path planning in UAVs. Studies and papers have been distinguished, and the following information was obtained and aggregated from each article: authors, publication’s year, the journal name or the conference name, proposed algorithms, the aim of the study, the outcome, and the quality of each study. According to the findings, the meta-heuristic algorithm is a standard optimization method for tackling single and multi-objective problems. Besides, the findings show that meta-heuristic algorithms have a great compact on the path planning optimization in UAVs, and there is good progress in this field. However, the problem still exists mainly in complex and dynamic environments, on battlefields, in rescue missions, mobile obstacles, and with multiple UAVs.},

abstract = {In the last few years, automatic guidance of agricultural vehicles has received increased interest to improve field efficiency, while releasing human workers from monotonous operations. In this context, this work proposes a short or medium-term alternative to complete automation of manual harvesting processes by introducing a fleet of robotic N-trailer vehicles to support the crop transportation task. With the aim of coordinate several vehicles which share the workspace with human pickers, this work presents a decentralized cooperative navigation strategy that divides the field into harvesting areas, allocates an active N-trailer vehicle per area, determines the number of trailers to use according to the payload capacity and maneuverability constraints, and coordinates the departure time of backup N-trailers in order to reduce non-productive times. The proposed strategy includes a harvesting sequence generation stage based on centralized global information, and a dynamic route planning stage based on both global and local information. In order to make the navigation strategy robust against the variability on the harvesting rate and the uncertainties about the field productivity, the global information is continuously updated based on local information from the vehicles. A simulator was built in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in realistic scenarios having different field productivity and machinery availability. Thus, by using a large fleet of N-trailers and properly coordinated them to share the workspace, the results showed an efficiency improvement of up to 82% with respect to the basic case where two vehicles (one active vehicle and one backup vehicle) were used to cover the whole field, as reported in the literature.}

abstract = {Articulated vehicles composed of a tractor and several passive trailers are commonly used for transportation purposes in agricultural applications. The increment of the number of trailers increases the payload capacity, but on the other hand, it also implies serious motion constraints, especially in turning scenarios where there is a greater risk of collisions with the crops. In this context, to reduce dangerous maneuvers during the headland turning scenarios, this paper presents a headland turning algorithmization for the N-trailers, characterized by unifying the motion planning stage with the motion control stage, in contrast to most of the available solutions which treat these stages independently. The proposed algorithmization delivers an admissible headland reference path and the location of the vehicle guidance point for the path-following task, to reduce both possible collisions with the crop and the inter-segment collisions. The proposed approach was validated by solving several illustrative problems which address various field/crop dimensions and vehicles with different number of trailers. The results showed that the proposed system can find and execute a safe maneuver in a broad range of known situations from the agricultural domain.}

abstract="In this chapter, we will only investigate the dry friction or Coulomb friction between two solid bodies. Friction between solid bodies is an extremely complicated physical phenomenon. It encompasses elastic and plastic deformations of the surface layers of the contacting bodies, interactions with wear particles, microfractures and the restoration of the continuity of materials, excitation of electrons and phonons, chemical reactions, and the transfer of particles from one body to the other. What is astonishing is the fact that it is possible to formulate a very simple law for dry friction. This first order approximation is sufficient for many engineering applications: The frictional force is proportional to the normal force and as good as independent from the speed. The astounding property of dry friction lies in the fact that in a first order approximation, it is dependent neither on contact area nor on roughness. This property allows us to use the notion of the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction, however, gives only a very rough first approximation of the quotient of frictional force to normal force.",
